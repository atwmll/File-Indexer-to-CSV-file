# Information

##### This code is free software -- utilize it for your organization as you please! I was assigned to make an indexer at my job and decided to share a less complicated and universal version of it because I believe it could be useful to many people outside of my organization.


##### The code is clearly commented, and contains useful examples on how you can use it for your specific needs.<br><br>If you have any suggestions, please feel free to pass along.
