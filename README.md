### What is it?
* #### A simple tool that indexes large amounts of files and adds their names, along with additional information (defaulted, but easily configurable by you!) to a Comma Separated Values (.csv) file that can be simply opened using Libre/Open Office or alternatively Microsoft Excel.

### Usage:
* #### File organization
* #### Record keeping

### How to use:
#### 1. Clone whole project
#### 2. Modify `Indexer.java`, `indexer.properties`, `log4j.properties` to your needs
#### 3. Open terminal
#### 4. Change directory (cd) into 'Indexer-run-jar' folder
#### 5. Run: `java -jar -Dlog4j.configuration=file:"./log4j.properties" Indexer-1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
#### 6. Profit!

# Information

##### This code is free software -- utilize it for your organization as you please! I was assigned to make an indexer at my job and decided to share a less complicated and universal version of it because I believe it could be useful to many people outside of my organization.


##### The code is clearly commented, and contains useful examples on how you can use it for your specific needs.

##### If you have any suggestions, please feel free to pass along.
